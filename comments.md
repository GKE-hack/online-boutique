Now, post this implementation I am seeing two issues:

1. If my session is there it is pretty good and there is good chatting. But when I navigate to a product page, the entire context is lost. I want it to remain through. Add that.

2. Plus, it should send back a clickable product link (the RAG response will have that ideally) - the LLM is generating a generic one. i.e. the product ID should be sent back as a clickable link for e.g ID : 9045 should be sent as a link for "<base-url>/product/product-id"
