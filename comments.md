So here are some bugs that the current code is facing and How I want to improve and fix it:

1. The chat component is very basic and doesnt follow formatting, streaming (Need this from the Gemini API) and also does not have basic chat session management of sorts.
2. The chat component pops out whenever I open another or refresh a page or smth like that which shouldnt happen.
